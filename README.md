# Zero-K-Inmortal-AI

The Inmortal AI is a AI for the game Zero-K.
I have motified the Brutal AI to be more challenging.
So credit to the Zero-K team for not only the base file,but also this amazing game.

Note:

The Inmortal isn't very inmortal at the momment. Exprineced players will easily crush this.

What is Zero-K?:

Zero-K is a free RTS that is very balanced. There are very few things that money can buy you, and nothing that can help you win. The AI never cheats! Not even the brutal!
